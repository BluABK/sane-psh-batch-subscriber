# Sane-PSH Batch Subscription Tool
Takes a `my_syubs.json` file of YouTube subscriptions on the API form `youtube#SubscriptionListResponse` (you can generate it using their API Explorer) and produces a list of cURL POST request commands.

## TODO
Use requests lib to make the tool itself make the POST requests.
